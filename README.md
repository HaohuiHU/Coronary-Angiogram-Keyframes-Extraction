# Dataset
The full dataset was collected from exams performed by a single catheterization laboratory during the period between January 2018 and December 2021.
Dataset consisted of 3159 angiographic study: a total of 37209 coronary angiograms was extracted. We used a sample of 45 angiograms to extract a total of
1434 frames of size 512 x 512 pixels.
A sample of the dataset is put in the "oneSampleCoro" section above.
All zipped dataset is put in the "all_dataSet_deep" section above.
